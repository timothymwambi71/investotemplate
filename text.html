  - Systematic Land Adjudication and Certification (SLAAC): Under a World Bank-funded initiative, we successfully issued 520 land titles to families in Obongi District.

These surveys played a critical role in land use planning, road construction, and infrastructure development, improving accessibility and economic growth.

Video Section
- African Sustainable Homes offers excellent combination of location & quality
- Around the world, 1.6 billion people lack decent housing. Approximately 200 million of these people live in Sub-Saharan African countries. We identified three major causes: a lack of wealth, optimal building materials, and unaccepting certain building materials. Many people in Africa, specifically Uganda, live in homes made of mud or timber, with grass and iron sheets as roofs. These materials rarely withstand rain, heat, and wind, meaning homes need to be rebuilt three or maybe four times yearly. A single repair costs roughly 100 euros, inflicting yearly costs of 300 euros for suboptimal living situations.
